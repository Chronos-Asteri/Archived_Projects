# Project Management Software

## The Motivations behind This Project

The process of starting the project management software was because this was my first every complete software project undertaking. What this app does is self-explanatory. Thus I started looking into how the software is made and what are the development stages of software development (this was before I started my college). Then the first thing I thought I should is to decide the overall structure of the project i.e. the overall design and implementation. That is what I did. These `pdfs` all the info regarding the project

## Why I archived This Project

I realized that that there were many existing software which accomplished which had equivalent if not more features and other services. Hence I determined that this size of the project is vastly out of scope for a single individual (although could be accomplished if given time)

## Main takeaways from this project 

A project of this caliber i.e. a completely designed project management software with a solid background and a fancy yet usable frontend is a very difficult endeavor. This requires quite a large number of workforce to accomplish this. Also since many existing project management software already exists, thus investing time and resources in this kind of project (unless given a worthwhile upgrade) is deemed as futile
